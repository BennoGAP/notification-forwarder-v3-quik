> **Note**
This fork is attempting to be up to date with new features. Ultimately, we'd like one app that allows for discord, slack, sms, matrix, etc natively, instead of through server-oriented bridges. By loading these as plugins, the user can put together a messaging app that fits their needs. The base app will handle SMS like its predecessor, but also load and use plugins for other messaging platforms.

It is a continuation to [QKSMS](https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms), which is  currently available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.octoshrimpy.quik) and on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=dev.octoshrimpy.quik). 

QUIK is not yet available to download, but will be available as an installable APK from the releases tab and F-Droid.
