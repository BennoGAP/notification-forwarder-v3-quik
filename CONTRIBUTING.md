## Submitting Issues
A great bug report contains a description of the problem and steps to reproduce the problem. We need to know what we're looking for and where to look for it.
When reporting a bug, please make sure to provide the following information:
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* QUIK version
* Device / OS information
## Testing Latest Versions
To do this, navigate to the release tab in this repository and click on releases. There are two types of releases in Quik. The first is the `Latest Release`.  It is colored green and is the version that goes out over the app stores. The other type is `Pre-Release`, which contains the latest features and may have bugs. To install this, download the apk from the release tab and install it on your phone. (Instructions can be found in the wiki for a more detailed explanation).
Once you have done this, simply use the app as normal, and report any bugs you come across.
